The <strong>INPUT</strong> chain is a set of rules that apply to incoming traffic.<br><br>

It is important to note that the rules in the INPUT chain apply only to traffic destined for the computer itself.
If the packet is intended for another computer and your computer only redirects it, this packet will be processed by the <strong>FORWARD</strong> chain.
